# Rock Paper Scissors Game in Python

Welcome to my Rock Paper Scissors game project! This simple yet engaging project was created using Python to bring the classic game to life on the command line.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `rps_game.py` file using the command: `python rps_game.py`.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose your move (rock, paper, or scissors).
5. The computer will randomly select its move, and the winner of the round will be determined based on the game rules.

## Features

- User-friendly command line interface.
- Randomized computer moves.
- Clear game logic to determine the winner of each round.

## Getting Involved

If you're interested in exploring the code and learning more about how the game works, feel free to dive into the `main.py` file. The code is well-documented, making it a great resource for those looking to understand basic Python programming and logic.

## Future Enhancements

This project served as a fantastic learning experience, but there's always room for improvement. Some potential enhancements for the future include:

- Adding a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience.
- Implementing additional gestures or moves to expand the gameplay.
- Incorporating a scoring system for multiple rounds.

## Contributions

If you're passionate about coding and game development, I welcome contributions and feedback. Whether you spot a bug, have an enhancement suggestion, or want to share your thoughts, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Connect with Me

I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers and enthusiasts. If you have any questions, ideas, or just want to chat, don't hesitate to reach out to me here on LinkedIn or through my other social media profiles.
